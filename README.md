# PhD-scripts
Scripts made and used during my PhD

Various scripts using pymatgen (see their documentation for details! they are great) ---- pymatgen.org

Initialising vasp calulations (KPOINTS, INCAR, POTCAR POSCAR etc..)

MD analysis (diffusion)

stability of calculation with materials project

electrochemical stability

More..

Note most of this will not require some personal tinkering
It is also unlikely I will continue to update this.
This is for a personal log of the work I have done and for anyone who might stumble across it and make use.

Please contact me at kab121@ic.ac.uk for more info or if I am breaking licencing etc..

Have a great day!
